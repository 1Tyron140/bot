hello

dealership.py :
    It's a program for the game car dealership tycoon and every other tycoon on roblox that allow you to idle for hours or days if you want and still earn money ( without it after 20 minutes of inactivity you get kicked), it's an alternative for non free programs and perfect for lazy players.

How it works ? You just have to boot the program and put the cursor on the game windows, let your computer alone and that's it. I will improve it later.

But, to stop the script you will have to close the terminal running the script because i dont how to close the program by pressing a key for instance.
